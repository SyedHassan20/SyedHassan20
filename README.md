<br>


Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <be>
I'm a biologist turned bioinformatician with a passion for efficient, replicable, and clear scientific solutions. I specialize in simulating biological concepts and statistical analyses of biological datasets.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a 4th-year Undergrad studying Biochemistry at Minerva University.
- Currently working as a Bioinformatics Intern at Sirota Lab, UCSF and a Research Assistant at SciCom Lab, Minerva University.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on Single-Cell Transcriptomics while learning Causal Inference, Simulation Modeling, and Machine Learning.
- ðŸ““ I am proficient in Python (+ React & Django), R (+ RShiny), Mathematica, and ML (Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, Sckit-learn).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m learning more about protein modeling, multi-omics data analysis, and how computational tools can drive discoveries in structural biology and drug development.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have lived in 6 countries over 4 years of undergrad, participating in diverse labs every single semester.

**Latest Accomplishments:**

- **CGA** - A Chemical-Gene Atlas for visualizing gene-chemical interactions with network plots for lethal genes in pre and post-natal diseases.
- **antiCLUST** â€“ An automated tool for balanced batch assignment in high-throughput sequencing, minimizing batch effects for unbiased multi-omics and ribosome profiling analysis.
