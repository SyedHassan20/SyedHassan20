<br>


Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <be>
I'm a biologist turned bioinformatician with a passion for efficient, replicable, and clear scientific solutions. I specialize in simulating biological concepts and statistical analyses of biological datasets.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a 4th-year Undergrad in Biochemistry at Minerva University.
- Currently working as a Research Assistant at SciCom Lab, Minerva University, and Bioinformatics Intern at UCSF Sirota Lab.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Causal Inference, Simulation Modeling, and Machine learning.
- ðŸ““ I am proficient in Python (+ Django), R (+ RShiny), Mathematica, and Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to learn more about protein modeling, multi-omics data analysis, and how computational tools can drive discoveries in structural biology and drug development.
